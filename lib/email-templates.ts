    body: `Dear {{name}},

You must wait 30 days to take the End-of-Course Exam again. This is part of the Florida Administrative Code, enforced by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) Real Estate Commission, which states that students who fail a Commission-prescribed end-of-course examination must wait at least 30 days from the original exam date before they are eligible to retest, and they may retest a maximum of one time within one year. If they fail again, they must repeat the course before being eligible to take the examination again.

The next day you can take the End-of-Course Exam will be on {{nextEligibleDate}}.

We recommend using these 30 days to ace the practice exam. This will help you to not only pass the End-Of-Course Exam, but will also prepare you for the Florida State Exam.
